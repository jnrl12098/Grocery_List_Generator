Current GUI Version: 0.07
* functional enough to deliver the minimum expected features:
	* create a grocery list from scratch with Edit, Insert, Add, Remove
	* edit and update (export) an inventory of ingredients; data persists after closing the program
	* create (even from scratch), edit, and update own recipes; data persists after closing the program
	* search for a recipe from a defined list of recipes
	* display ingredients for a recipe
	* add the ingredients of a recipe to the grocery list while also filtering the ingredients
		that are still present in the inventory

* NEW Quality of Life (but necessary) update:
	* message box to warn the user to save any unsaved changes to the inventory list when they exit the program
